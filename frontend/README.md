Welcome to the frontend part of the testbed project. This folder contains the source code for our frontend application.

## Structure

  - `components`: Contains reusable React components that make up our application's UI.
    - `css`: Holds CSS files used for styling the components.
    - `img`: Holds Image files used for the website.
    - Other JS components and pages
  - `services`: Includes services responsible for making API requests or handling other backend interactions.

- `public`: This directory contains public assets that will be directly served by the web server.
